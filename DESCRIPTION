Description: Indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) represents an early
        intermediate of the biosynthesis of a variety of indolic
        secondary metabolites including the phytoanticipin
        indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and the phytoalexin camalexin
        (3-thiazol-2'-yl-indole). Arabidopsis thaliana cyp79B2 cyp79B3
        double knockout plants are completely impaired in the
        conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime and do not
        accumulate IAOx-derived metabolites any longer. Consequently,
        comparative analysis of wild-type and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plant
        lines has the potential to explore the complete range of
        IAOx-derived indolic secondary metabolites.
