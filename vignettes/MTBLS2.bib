  abstract = {Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) is a commonly used
        analytical platform for non-targeted metabolite profiling experiments.
        Although data acquisition, processing and statistical analyses are
        almost routine in such experiments, further annotation and subsequent
        identification of chemical compounds are not. For identification,
        tandem mass spectra provide valuable information towards the struct
ure
        of chemical compounds. These are typically acquired online , in data-dependent
        mode, or offline , using handcrafted acquisition methods and manually
        extracted from raw data. Here, we present several methods to fast-track
        and improve both the acquisition and processing of LC–MS/MS data.
        Our nearly online ( nearline ) data-dependent tandem MS strategy
        creates a minimal set of LC–MS/MS acquisition methods for relevant
        features revealed by a preceding non-targeted profiling experiment.
        Using different filtering criteria, such as intensity or ion type,
        the acquisition of irrelevant spectra is minimized. Afterwards, LC–MS/MS
        raw data are processed with feature detection and grouping algorithms.
        The extracted tandem mass spectra can be used for both library search
        and de-novo identification methods. The algorithms are implemented
        in the R package MetShot and support the export to Bruker, Agilent
        or Waters QTOF instruments and the vendor-independent TraML standard.
        We evaluate the performance of our workflow on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q
        by comparison of automatically acquired and extracted tandem mass
        spectra obtained from a mixture of natural product standards against
        manually extracted reference spectra. Using Arabidopsis thaliana
        wild-type and biosynthetic gene knockout plants, we characterize
        the metabolic products of a biosynthetic pathway and demonstrate
        the integration of our approach into a typical non-targeted metabolite
        profiling workflow.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is routinely used
        for metabolomics experiments. In contrast to the fairly routine and
        automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation
        and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form
        a major bottleneck in data interpretation. Here we present CAMERA,
        a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound
        spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate
        compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms,
        we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation
        for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at
        different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate
        masses for 89.7\% and 90.3\% of the annotatable compounds in positive
        and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel
        annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired
        in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We
        demonstrate the utility of CAMERA in two different, easily adoptable
        plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of CAMERA drastically
        reduced the amount of manual analysis.},
